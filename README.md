# dogs-vision
Dogs see primarily in **blue and yellow**, lacking red-green perception. They have excellent **night vision** due to more rod cells and the **tapetum lucidum**. Their **wide field of view** helps detect motion but reduces **visual detail**. Motion sensitivity is strong, aiding in hunting and spotting distant threats.
