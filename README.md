Introduction to TensorFlow, Deep Learning and Transfer Learning (work in progress)
Project: Dog Vision üê∂üëÅ - Using computer vision to classify dog photos into different breeds.
Goals: Learn TensorFlow, deep learning and transfer learning, beat the original research paper results (22% accuracy).
Domain: Computer vision.
Data: Images of dogs from Stanford Dogs Dataset (120 dog breeds, 20,000+ images).
Problem type: Multi-class classification (120 different classes).
Runtime: This project is designed to run end-to-end in Google Colab (for free GPU access and easy setup). If you'd like to run it locally, it will require environment setup.
Welcome, welcome!

The focus of this notebook is to give a quick overview of deep learning with TensorFlow/Keras.

How?

We're going to go through the machine learning workflow steps and build a computer vision project to classify photos of dogs into their respective dog breed (a Predictive AI task, see below for more).







# dogs-vision
Dogs see primarily in **blue and yellow**, lacking red-green perception. They have excellent **night vision** due to more rod cells and the **tapetum lucidum**. Their **wide field of view** helps detect motion but reduces **visual detail**. Motion sensitivity is strong, aiding in hunting and spotting distant threats.
